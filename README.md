This is my NBA 3 PT % vs Box Score Plus Minus mini project. I used a simple linear regression to illustrate the importance of the 3PT shot in the current era. Surprisingly, the P Value is around .04, which rejects the null hypothsis of B0 = 0. This suggests that the point line does have profound influence in today's game.

User would only have to slide the box in order to input the number. The number is in percentages. Ex 35 = 35%. The Ouput will show projected Box Plus Minus.
